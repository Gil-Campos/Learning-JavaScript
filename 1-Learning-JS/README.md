# Learning JavaScript

This README is to keep track of the tutorial I've been taking (and hopefully finishing) because I know nothing about JS but I want to start building my own servers in node and mongo.

JavaScripts seems to be like Korean it has so many words but you end up using just a few of them in your day to day, not gonna lie this will take me some time.
